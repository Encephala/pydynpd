    "With lag (2 2) I have instructed Stata to use only the second lag of the endogenous variables asinstruments. Due to the small number of countries in my sample a large number of instrumentscauses the Sargan test (explained below) to be weak. The rule of thumb is to keep the number ofinstruments less than or equal to the number of groups. Stata warns you about that at the top of theoutput table. The second lag is required, because it is not correlated with the current error term,while the first lag is. Generally, one can experiment with a second or deeper lags to find a goodinstrument, but using deeper lags reduces sample size. If the number of countries is large enough,one may use all available lags (second and deeper lags) as instruments.\n",

As a result, estimating Eq ($\\ref{fd}$) directly produces inconsistent result. Instrumental variables are used to solve the issue. [@arellano1991some]suggest to use all lagged $y$ dated $t-2$ and earlier (i.e., $y_{i,1}$, $y_{i,2}$,\\..., $y_{i,t-2}$) as instruments for $\\Delta y_{i,t-1}$.
